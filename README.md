# Hangul

There's a lot of tools for learning Hangul but I needed something very simple where you can just do drills. I'm not a big fan of mnemonics because they make you carry a lot of additional context, so I usually just brute-force it until I remember it. Gohoneko made an amazing kana trainer, which became inspiration for this one.

Pick any combination of the 4 groups (simple vowels, diphthongs, simple consonants, doubled consonants) and just grind to your heart's content! You get a score of correct / total answers, which you can aim to improve (gamification!), and if you're unsure about how to pronounce a letter, just click "Play sound".
